In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.\n","\n","Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.\n","\n","NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package is great for dummies to perform sentiment analysis because it requires only the textual data to make predictions. For example:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",">>> txt = \"Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide. \n","\n","Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do.\"\n",">>> analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n",">>> analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)\n","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}\n","```\n","\n","In this challenge, however, you will not use NLTK's sentiment analysis package because in your Machine Learning training in the past 2 weeks you have learned how to make predictions more accurate than that. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. You will be able to use the Na√Øve Bayes classifier you learned in the lesson to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the labels."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"knHBCiDyDscc"},"source":["## Conducting Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","### Loading and Exploring Data\n","\n","The dataset we'll be using today is located on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). Once you have downloaded and imported the dataset, it you will need to define the columns names: df.columns = ['target','id','date','flag','user','text']\n","\n","*Notes:* \n","\n","* The dataset is huuuuge (1.6m tweets). When you develop your data analysis codes, you can sample a subset of the data (e.g. 20k records) so that you will save a lot of time when you test your codes."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import re\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer \n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dKbUk0SXzX6f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('tagsets')\n","nltk.download('omw-1.4')\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ladVLAZ8zb0l","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677920195426,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":1439,"user":{"displayName":"Natasha Benson","userId":"06712938369389388973"}},"outputId":"867b8ea4-b6c3-4822-ef70-f3b5d2d9f16a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package tagsets to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping help/tagsets.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package omw-1.4 to /root/nltk_data...\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"P2-b5OkvzX_U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677920217855,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":22432,"user":{"displayName":"Natasha Benson","userId":"06712938369389388973"}},"outputId":"a3e34818-e753-4377-d522-9dfc4dc2fcd7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":361},"id":"p32sPmwEDscd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677920230504,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":12655,"user":{"displayName":"Natasha Benson","userId":"06712938369389388973"}},"outputId":"4c11c9ac-85a0-47a8-c72b-ef6d56b7f67b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:3326: FutureWarning: The error_bad_lines argument has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","\n","\n","  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   0  1467810369  Mon Apr 06 22:19:45 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY _TheSpecialOne_  \\\n","0  0  1467810672  Mon Apr 06 22:19:49 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY   scotthamilton   \n","1  0  1467810917  Mon Apr 06 22:19:53 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY        mattycus   \n","2  0  1467811184  Mon Apr 06 22:19:57 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY         ElleCTF   \n","3  0  1467811193  Mon Apr 06 22:19:57 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY          Karoli   \n","4  0  1467811372  Mon Apr 06 22:20:00 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY        joy_wolf   \n","\n","  @switchfoot http://twitpic.com/2y1zl - Awww, that's a bummer.

The bag of words contains all the unique words in your whole text body (a.k.a. *corpus*) with the number of occurrence of each word. It will allow you to understand which words are the most important features across the whole corpus.\n","\n","Also, you can imagine you will have a massive set of words. The less important words (i.e. those of very low number of occurrence) do not contribute much to the sentiment. Therefore, you only need to use the most important words to build your feature set in the next step. In our case, we will use the top 5,000 words with the highest frequency to build the features.\n","\n","In the cell below, combine all the words in `text_processed` and calculate the frequency distribution of all words. A convenient library to calculate the term frequency distribution is NLTK's `FreqDist` class ([documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#module-nltk.probability)). Then select the top 5,000 words from the frequency distribution."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iafeL4tvDscg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677920247486,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":41,"user":{"displayName":"Natasha
